# RustCrypto: Elliptic Curves ![Rust Version][rustc-image] [![Project Chat][chat-image]][chat-link] [![dependency status][deps-image]][deps-link]

**Warning**: This crate was unprofessionally modified to work with cbindgen for embedded systems, which breaks compilation on non-32bit targets!

General purpose Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) support, including types
and traits for representing various elliptic curve forms, scalars, points,
and public/secret keys composed thereof.

All curves reside in the separate crates and implemented using traits from
the [`elliptic-curve`](https://docs.rs/elliptic-curve/) crate.

Crates in this repo do not require the standard library (i.e. `no_std` capable)
and can be easily used for bare-metal or WebAssembly programming.

NOTE: Some crates contain field/point arithmetic implementations gated under the
`arithmetic` cargo feature as noted above.

Please see our [tracking issue for additional elliptic curves][other-curves]
if you are interested in curves beyond the ones listed here.
